Enter in the directory to search (being specific is much faster) 
Enter in where input file is located, along with its name so you can have it named whatever
Enter in where you want output file to print (will always be named 'search_results.txt')
Enter in file extension

This allows the tool to search through directories and the subdirectories inside for certain keywords located in files.
